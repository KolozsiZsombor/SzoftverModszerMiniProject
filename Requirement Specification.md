# Requirement Specification

## 1. Current situation

  There is currently no central online platform where users can share jokes, rate them and interact with each other in a joke-based community. The sharing and rating of jokes is rather sporadic, taking place on various social media platforms and forums. These platforms do not provide dedicated features for rating, organising and publishing jokes.

## 2. Dream Situation

  The aim is to create a user friendly joke website where users can easily share and rate jokes. Registered accounts can upload jokes and rate others. Users can read, react and rate the jokes, just to read jokes you dont have to register ann account and can browse anonymously. Jokes with good ratings will be at the top of the page while badly rated ones will be mostly at the bottom. There would also be a hidden admin interface to manage the platform and take down jokes in case one gets uploaded that violate the profanity/bad word filter.
