# Requirement Specification

## 1. Current situation

  There is currently no central online platform where users can share jokes, rate them and interact with each other in a joke-based community. The sharing and rating of jokes is rather sporadic, taking place on various social media platforms and forums. These platforms do not provide dedicated features for rating, organising and publishing jokes.

## 2. Dream Situation

  The aim is to create a user friendly joke website where users can easily share and rate jokes. Registered accounts can upload jokes and rate others. Users can read, react and rate the jokes, just to read jokes you dont have to register ann account and can browse anonymously. Jokes with good ratings will be at the top of the page while badly rated ones will be mostly at the bottom. There would also be a hidden admin interface to manage the platform and take down jokes in case one gets uploaded that violate the profanity/bad word filter.

## 3. Current Business Modell

Currently, users find and share jokes through various platforms with the following processes:

- **Discovery**: Searching for jokes on social media or forums.
- **Sharing**: Manually copy pasting jokes in order to share them.
- **Rating**: Informal feedback through comments or likes, often limited.
- **Engagement**: Minimal interaction due to the dispersed nature of platforms.

## 4. Desired Business Modell
The new system will streamline the following processes:

1. **User Registration**:
   - Users create accounts with email verification.
   - Profile management for personalized experience.

2. **Joke Submission**:
   - Users submit jokes with categories and tags for organization.
   - Submission must not includes multimedia (images, videos) in order to keep down data storage requirements.

3. **Rating and Feedback**:
   - Users rate jokes and leave comments.
   - A moderation process to flag inappropriate content.

4. **Content Discovery**:
   - Users can search and filter jokes based on categories, ratings, and popularity.
   - Daily/weekly highlights of top content.

5. **Community Engagement**:
   - Users can follow others, create joke collections, and share them.
   - Notifications for user interactions (likes, comments).
