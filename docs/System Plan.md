## 1. Objective
The goal is to develop a simple, user-friendly platform where users can share, browse, and rate jokes. Registration is required only for posting and rating, while reading and reacting to jokes can be done anonymously. Jokes will be sorted based on user ratings, and a hidden admin interface will enable platform management, including moderation and enforcement of a profanity filter.
